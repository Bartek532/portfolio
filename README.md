## Project Overview 🎨

This is my own portfolio where I show my work. I'm constantly updating them, although it's difficult because I still create new projects, but I try to keep everything up to date 😁

UPDATE: Keeping all the information up to date was very cumbersome as I had to interfere with the code, so I decided to implement fetching content from the [headless CMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_content_management_system) 😄
